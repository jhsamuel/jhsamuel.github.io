###First-year graduate student, University of Pittsburgh Department of Philosophy
This past spring I completed a Masters in philosophy at UW-Milwaukee, and this fall I will begin the philosophy PhD program at the University of Pittsburgh. I wrote an MA thesis under the supervision of prof. William H Bristow on the applicability of Sellars' critique of Givenness to the practical domain, using Ruth Chang's 'Hybrid Voluntarism' as a foil. My most active current interest is in continuing to explore these issues with a view toward ultimately developing a neo-Hegelian position in meta-normativity. I'm also interested in inferentialist semantics and speech-act theory&mdash;in particular on its applicability to linguistic-constructivist feminism, 19th and 20th century Continental philosophy, political theory (especially classical anarchsm, Marx and critical theory, and Foucault), pragmatism, speculative fiction (especially Neal Stephenson), tattoos, indie teen romances and coming-of-age movies, listening to and playing music, occasionally skateboarding (in my advanced age I've been drawn toward exclusively skating small ramps), vegan cooking, and beagles. Clearly I don't have the time to actively pursue all of my interests. But then, only the boring and the independently wealthy do.

I'm currently reading *The Birth of Biopolitics*, *System of the World* (the Neal Stephenson novel, not the second volume of Newton's *Principia*), and a plumbing guide from the "Tauton's Complete" series, and daydreaming about building a tiny house on a trailer like the ones that [Tumbleweed Houses][1] makes.
