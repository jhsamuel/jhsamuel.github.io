#Research
##Research Statement

Lately, I've thinking about some stuff and sometimes writing about it.

##Publications

Coming soon... I hope.

##In Progress

###"The Myth of Given Reasons"

In which I argue that Ruth Chang's conception of 'Hierarchical Voluntarism' is susceptible to Sellars' Critique of 'Givenness.' [abstract](/Abstract-tmogr.pdf/)

###"It Doesn't Matter What You 'Meant': The Pragmatic Topography of Sexist Slurs*"

In which I argue that inferentialist speech-act theory, as developed by Rebecca Kukla and Mark Lance, provides the resources to develop a rigorous account of linguistic constructivist feminism in the vein of Wittiq, Butler, Foucault, etc. [abstract](/Abstract-ptss.pdf/)
